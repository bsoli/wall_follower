#Here is where you can define all of your states in a clever way to make your code more readable.
#Think of all the states your robot could be in if thrown randomly into a world.
#Currently the code is set up for a variable name being equal to an integer like:

FOUND = 1
FOLLOWING = 2
LOOKING = 3

#for each of your states.
